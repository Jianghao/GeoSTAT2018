**Urban Sensing and Computing - Big Data Analytic with Open Source Software**

**Abstract**: The growing volumes of data available from smart phone, internet of things, social media and other digital interconnected systems provide us a new way to investigate city environment. How to better understanding our city with these kind of big data and turning it into knowledge and intelligence with data mining technology is becoming the key challenge in quantitative urban research. In this talk, I will first present the urban studies with geospatial big data to improve social, economic, and environmental well-being in China. Some case studies that using mobile phone and social media data to model urban dynamics, human behavior, and environment awareness with open source software for real-time geocomputation will present for discussion.
